# Data-Science-project---Text-Scraping-Classification
Data Science project - Text Scraping &amp; Classification. In this project, made for module called Data Science in Python from my first Master in Social Data Analytics, what I had to do was do web scraping to extract the import and import it, Constructing a document-term matrix building two multi-class classification models on the data
The main steps of the project are:
 - Scraping and storing the title and body text of all news articles, and
   filtering irrelevant content.
 - Retrieving and storing the category labels for all news articles
 - Loading the data into an appropriate representation for analysis.
 - Constructing a document-term matrix, using appropriate text preprocessing and
   term weighting steps.
 - Building two multi-class classification models on the data, with two different
   classification algorithms.
 - Running an appropriate experimental evaluation to compare the performance of
   the two classification models, using one or more performance criteria.
 - Presenting, visualising, and discussing the results of the experimental evaluation.
